### Overview
Currently, my ressearch activities are dedicated to IoT systems and networks.
In details, I am working on the PHY and MAC layers from a protocol and an hardware point of view.
In this context, I am starting new research activities with a focus on the Cyber Security issues and associated counter-measure for IoT platforms. 


More generally, I am interested by ambient intelligent systems and networks.


Related to my previous position, I am contributing to the development of the <a class="text-success" href="http://recherche.telecom-bretagne.eu/xaal/" title="xAAL project website">xAAL</a> solution.
It is a distributed infrastructure and a message bus over IP aiming to fight home automation protocols interoperability issues.


### Interests

- PHY/MAC Cyber Security attacks and counter-measures
- IoT embedded platforms: embedded hypervisor and hardware acceleration with fpga
- IoT and 5G
- Home automation protocols
- Sensors/Actuators networks (Classical and Cognitive)
- Ambient Assited Living (AAL) systems
- Companion robot @Home and IoT networks
- Ambient intelligence
- Experimental testbed based on software defined radio concepts
- User tests, co-design, user-centered design


### Past Research

- Power Line Communication in-vehicle.
- Channel (in-vehicle powerline) measurements and characterization: transfert function and noise analysis.
- Software defined radio apply to powerline communication: the GNUradio project and the USRP2 card.
