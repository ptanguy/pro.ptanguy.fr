### Overview
My ressearch activities are dedicated to ambient assisted living systems and networks.

I am participating to the development of the <a class="text-success" href="http://recherche.telecom-bretagne.eu/xaal/" title="xAAL project website">xAAL</a> solution.
It is a distributed infrastructure and a message bus over IP aiming to fight home automation protocols interoperability issues.
Moreover, I work on the PREventive Care Infrastructure based On Ubiquitous Sensing (<a class="text-success" href="http://www.thepreciousproject.eu" title="PRECIOUS project website">PRECIOUS</a>) project funded by the European Union and part of eHealth and Ageing initiative.
We are proposing xAAL in the health care context to monitor home environment risk factors (temperature, humidity, luminosity, etc.) and to deliver user feedbacks.

### Interests
