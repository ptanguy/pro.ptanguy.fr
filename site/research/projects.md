<h3>Current</h3>
<h4>PRECIOUS project</h4>
<p>The PREventive Care Infrastructure based On Ubiquitous Sensing (<a href="http://www.thepreciousproject.eu/">PRECIOUS</a>) project funded by the European Union and part of eHealth and Ageing initiativei.
</p>

<h3>Past</h3>
<h4>CIFAER project</h4>
<p>The CIFAER research project concerns the definition of an embedded architecture, innovative both in terms of electronic control unit (ECU) and communication interfaces supported (RF & PLC).
New services for the software layers of the system that supports such an infrastructure are proposed.
The design of such system is facilited by the addition of new methods incorporating the reconfigurable nature of the proposed architecture.
The project objectives are part of the topic "Innnovative Architectures and Methodology for the design of on-chip architectures" of the call for projects "Architecture of the future".
