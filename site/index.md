Hello, welcome on my professional website !

I am associate professor at INSA de Rennes in the SRC (System and Communicating Networks) department.
I am working with the SYSCOM team of the IETR laboratory.
I have a PhD in Electronics and digital communication.
Currently, my ressearch activities are dedicated to IoT systems and networks.
In this context, I am starting new research activities with a focus on the Cyber Security issues and associated counter-measure.
