Hello, welcome on my professional website !

I am working at Telecom Bretagne Brest in the computer science department and the IHSEV team of the lab-STICC (CNRS UMR 6285). I work on the PREventive Care Infrastructure based On Ubiquitous Sensing [PRECIOUS]("http://www.thepreciousproject.eu/") project funded by the European Union and part of eHealth and Ageing initiative. 

Currently, my research activities are dedicated to ambient assisted living systems and networks. I have a PhD in Electronics and digital communication and an expertise in digital communication for powerline communication.
